<h1>Shoes and Brews</h1>
<h2>Can't decide between Running Shoes and Beer? Now you don't have to choose</h2>
<p>The Shoe Closet and Brewery of Eva Kubasiak</p>

<h3>Shoes that fit your feet, and Brews that hit your tastebuds.</h3>
<p>I know that you need new running shoes. Even if you don't run, you need them for proper arch support and all that kind of stuff. So come buy them from the wall, so you don't hit it on your next run.</p>
